# Development and maintenance of Bradford Abbas Parish Council website

## Development system hardware architecture

As of October 24th 2022 the *dev* system will now work on Apple Silicon (ARM64) hardware but should also work on an Intel hardware platform just by choosing the appropriate Bento box and editing it into `vm/vagrant.config.yml`

## Quick start. 

1. `cd && clone git@github.com:iainhouston/bradford-abbas.uk.git`

2. Add the following alias to your `~/.zshrc`;  `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_aliases` as appropriate):

  ```sh 
  alias cdbadev="cd ${HOME}/bradford-abbas.uk && source ./SYMBOLS.sh && source ./scripts/badev/motd.sh"
  ```
  
  `SYMBOLS.sh` is an essential file defining symbols used in other files dotted around this directory sructure 

3. `% source ~/.zshrc`

4. `% cdbadev` =>  
  
    ```sh
        checkVersions  - Review  software required for development
        cloneLive2Dev  - Sync live database and static files to Dev server
        reload_db      - Reload Dev database with most recently downloaded live database
        endev          - Enable development modules in Dev site
        safecex        - Safe export of Dev site's configuration
        updateLiveCode - Code and Config to Live site
        	  ...
        MOTD message
	```
    
5.  `vagrant up` 
    
## Provisioning

Step 5 above provisions the **Development** Server

You will find [detailed instructions](prod/README.md) to provision the **Live** Server

## Required software

On the development machine into which this repo is cloned, you'll need to have installed:

+  Virtualisation software (I use Parallels, previously Oracle Virtualbox)

+  PHP (to run drush)

+  Composer (to install Drupal and contributed modules and Themes) 

+  Vagrant and vagrant plugins (to run the provisioning tasks)

+  Ruby (required by `vagrant`; available by default on MacOS)

+  Ansible (to run the provisioning tasks). 

+  NodeJS and npm (Required when developing the website's Appearance / Theme)  

+  Firefox Developer Edition (favourite browser when developing the Theme's CSS)

Do `checkVersions` to list the versions of all the above required software. A typical out is incuded below.

**Notes:**

+  I use `brew install ...` to install PHP, Composer, Vagrant, Ansible, and NodeJS (node). Very convenient. 

+  I purchased Parallels Desktop for other reasons. I used the free Oracle VirtualBox for many years but quite frequently came across issues of compatibility with other components. 

+  Different virtual boxes implicitly require different virtualisation software. `vagrant_box: bento/ubuntu-20.04` used in `vm/vagrant.conf.yml` is configured to require Parallels virtualisation

+  Last but not least: ["Get the latest features, fast performance, and the development tools you need to build for the open web"](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/developer/)
