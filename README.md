# Development and maintenance of Bradford Abbas Parish Council website

## Quick start. 

1. `cd && clone git@github.com:iainhouston/bradford-abbas.uk.git`

2. Add the following alias to your `~/.zshrc`;  `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_aliases` as appropriate):

  ```sh 
  alias cdbadev="cd ${HOME}/bradford-abbas.uk && source ./SYMBOLS.sh && source ./scripts/badev/motd.sh"
  ```
  
  `SYMBOLS.sh` is an essential file defining symbols used in other files dotted around this directory sructure 

3. `% source ~/.zshrc`

4. `% cdbadev` =>  
  
    ```sh
        checkVersions  - Review  software required for development
        cloneLive2Dev  - Sync live database and static files to Dev server
        reload_db      - Reload Dev database with most recently downloaded live database
        endev          - Enable development modules in Dev site
